    <h1>Mission Statement:</h1>
    <p>
      To create a better environment within South African informal settlements for animals and their owners.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Tin Can Town?</h3>
    <p>
      Officially known as Symphony Way Temporary Relocation Area, but dubbed locally as Blikkiesdorp, (Afrikaans for Tin Can Town, due to the rows of tin like, one room shelter homes) it is an informal settlement, approximately 15 minutes out of the CBD of
      Cape Town, South Africa. It was created by the government in 2007, as a way of relocating all of the misplaced people of Cape Town into a community environment. The citizens share one sanitation and water facility between 4 structures and the informal
      settlement has become known for its substandard living conditions, high crime rate and extreme hot and cold.
    </p>

    <h3>What do we do?</h3>

    <p>
      Tin Can Town Inc. is a registered non-for-profit charity. Tin Can Town, the group of dedicated volunteers, began with 5 friends who decided to volunteer their time and do what they could to improve the welfare of impoverished animals living in Blikkiesdorp.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dedicated team work closely with the community by educating and providing advice to community members who have animal companions within their care. Veterinary care is provided to as many animals as possible. The team also focuses on feeding and improving
      the lives of the human residents in return for their cooperation in providing access to their animals.
    </p>

    <p>
      The team visit Blikkiesdorp every second Sunday and provide a tick and mange prevention bath along with a supply of dog and cat food to any member of the community. The team also undertake emergency visits for the residents who are financially unable
      to care for their animals when required (This is where the majority of funds are spent as the list of patients grows every day). These emergencies often include hit by car accidents, gunshot wounds, emaciation, dehydration and major infections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tin Can Town also provides food and any other supplies they can to better the lives of the families living in the settlement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tin Can Town aims to provide vaccination and desexing drives, to extend the lives of these animals and to prevent future illnesses from occurring, as prevention is always better than cure. As funds are usually spent providing life saving veterinary care,
      this is a very difficult project to get off the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially this project used the team's own funds but very quickly realised how great the need is. Since then, they rely on family, friends and strangers to help us in any which way they can. The crew on the ground use their private cars, resources and
      donate their time.
    </p>

    <h3>How did Tin Can Town Australia start?</h3>
    <p>
      Tin Can Town Australia all began when 2 sisters decided to embark on a volunteer working holiday in Africa at a wildlife sanctuary in 2014. A mutual friend of the team in South Africa knew that the girls we would be passing through and would be interested
      in meeting some like-minded individuals overseas and suggested casually meeting up with the Tin Can Town team whilst in South Africa.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon discovering Tin Can Town's plight, the sisters jumped into action straight away to gather funds and as much veterinary supplies as they could manage to help them in their mission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon visiting Blikkiesdorp, the harshness of Blikkiesdorp's situation was confronting and was an experiences not easily forgotten. It was quickly evident that this was a small team facing an uphill battle to conquer a huge problem. The animals in Blikkiesdorp
      are suffering, they are exposed to the elements, starving and many are carrying a belly full of worms. Many dogs were sick or injured and not all could be helped on this one day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon returning home to Australia, their other sister heard their stories and looked at their photographs and could also not sit idly by. It was her that pushed for bigger goals. The three of us have big hearts, big goals, big dreams and are surrounded
      by compassionate and generous family and friends that have inspired them to create a charity that will make a real difference to many lives and make many tails wag.
    </p>
