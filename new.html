              <h3>Mobile-Friendly</h3>
              <p>
                  The web has changed and so has it's users. More users than ever are connecting online with mobile devices
                  as Google <a href="https://adwords.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html" target="_blank">Announced</a>
                  in May 2015 more searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan.
                  This mean responsive web design (Mobile-friendly design) is the new standard for the modern internet. It's imperative
                  your site works on all devices or risk being left behind or worse penalised in google natural search.
                  On April 21st 2015 Google rolled out their
                  <a href="https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-friendly-update.html" target="_blank">
                      Mobile-Friendly Update</a> meaning sites which are responsive will appear higher on mobile search results than those which are not.
                  I am well versed in all the latest techniques in terms of responsive design and will ensure the solution I design for your project
                  will work perfect on every device.

              <h3>Search Engine Optimisation</h3>
              <p>
                  I start forming an SEO strategy for a website even before a line of code is written
                  this bottom up approach ensures nothing is left to chance.
                  This strategy is pivotal to all steps of the project and culminates with a final pass
                  with various software applications to ensure your best foot is forward prior to launch.
                  I can provide training on how to use Google Analytics or
                  I can even take care of it for you and send you automated google analytics reports.

              <h3>Content Management Systems</h3>
              <p>
                  A content management system (CMS) gives the power back to you the site owner to edit and manage the
                  content on your site. A CMS is ideal for sites which contain events, blogs, news and announcements.
                  SEO Friendly in nature and helps to grow your audience.

              <h3>Social Media Intergration</h3>
              <p>
                  There is no better to grow your audience then by connecting to them.
                  Social media is yet another way to increase your presence online and
                  reach new markets. Social media is where people like to spend a great deal of their time online.
                  I can integrate social media as part of your next web project.
