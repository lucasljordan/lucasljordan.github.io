                as Google <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html" target="_blank">Announced</a>
                in May 2015 more searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan.
                This mean responsive web design is the new standard for modern web design. It's imperative your site works on all devices

            <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
            <p>
                I start forming an SEO strategy for a website even before a line of code is written
                this bottom up approach ensures nothing is left to chance.
                This strategy is pivotal to all steps of project and culminates with a final pass
                with various software to ensure your best foot forward prior to lunch.
                I can provide training on how to use Google Analytics or
                I can even take care of it for you and send you automated monthly reports.

            <p>
                A content management system (CMS) gives the power back to you the site owner to edit and manage to
                content on your site. A CMS is ideal for sites which contain events, blogs, news and announcements.
                SEO Friendly in nature help to grow your audience.
