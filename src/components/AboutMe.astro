      My journey building websites began as a hobby back in 2003 when I
      purchased HTML for the World Wide Web by Elizabeth Castro at a local
      bookstore for $10. Armed with the knowleded I had gained from that book I
      started hacking together custom Myspace themes for fun and friends as well
      as making small personal websites and projects. Eventually when I got
      older I studied computer science at La Trobe University where I gained a
      Bachelor in Information Systems before finally gaining my first real job
      as a PHP Developer in 2013.

    <p>
      After around a year of cutting my teeth I naturally fell in love with UI
      design and development which reignited the passion for the web I first
      flet all those years ago and I haven't looked back since!
