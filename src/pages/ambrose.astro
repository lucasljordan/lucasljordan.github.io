        <h1>Ambrose</h1>

        <p>
          Abrose is our adorable black and white cat. My wife are I adopted him
          from a shelter in 2013. He is quite scared of other people but is
          increadibly affectionate to my wife and I. He gives us tight kolala
          like hugs and often likes to give me these while I'm on zoom meetings
          on the days I work from home.
        </p>

        <p>This page is dedicated to my favourite little guy Ambrose!</p>
