    Animal Management, dog grooming, doggy day care and boarding.
    Tegan has a Cert IV in Animal Control and a Cert III in Animal Studies and has a keen interest
    in Animal welfare issues. Tegan is kept busy during the day working as an Animal care Educator and is kept
    busy outside of work as an owner of 2 dogs and 2 cats and her involvement as an active volunteer for local non for profit organisations.
    A love for travel, puppy dogs and Africa have fuelled an passion for helping South African animals.
  </p>

  <h3>Lea</h3>

  <p>
    Lea is the business minded middle sister with a strong drive to get things done the right way.
    Lea has a working history in numerous helpful areas, including finance, property management and
    hospitality, which will push Tin Can Town in an upwards direction and is definitely the right person to keep all of the paperwork on track.
    Lea enjoys relaxing with her partner, Brendan and her dogs and cats in her spare time.
    Lea loves new experiences and can’t wait to one day set foot in Blikkiesdorp and see it all for herself.
  </p>

  <h3>Paige</h3>

  <p>
    Paige is a qualified Veterinary Nurse and Dog Groomer and has been working in the animal industry
    most of her working life. She is the youngest of the 3 sisters and has a strong drive to always grow her knowledge and experience base.
    In her spare time, Paige enjoys hanging out with her cats, rabbits and chickens and one day dreams
    of owning her own small rescue hobby farm. She has a special interest in exotic animals,
    which propels her to find new volunteer experiences overseas and in new environments.
    Paige has left a small piece of her heart in Africa and cannot forget her personal experiences whilst visiting there.
  </p>

  <h3>Jess</h3>

  <p>
    Jess is a busy mum of two boys that runs her own successful graphic design business.
    Jess has a brood of free range chickens, 2 Golden Retrievers and a bunny rabbit.
    Jess uses her eye for design (and patience) to keep us stylish,
    assists with social media and merchandise design. Jess has a special knack
    for translating everybody’s unique ideas into a beautiful working picture.
  </p>

  <h3>Rosie Kunneke</h3>

  <p>
    Rosie has undergone major life changes to do what she believes in.
    Unwavering in her pursuit, she gets result. She left a yuppie lifestyle
    with all the trimmings to become one of the fiercest proponents of animal rights in the global movement.
  </p>

  <p>
    She has travelled to Antarctica to brave extreme weather conditions to make sure the Japanese
    Whaling fleet doesn’t fire another harpoon at a whale in a sanctuary, she has faced off with
    gunmen in Namibia when she tried to show the world how the country crudely bludgeons
    baby seals to death, and she has challenged the criminal underworld in Japan when they
    tried to kidnap her for documenting the whole sale slaughter of dolphins. She is beautiful and fierce.
  </p>

  <h3>Dinielle St&ouml;ckigt</h3>

  <p>
    Dinielle is a mystery. Tall and gentle, never raising her voice, she is the calm in the storm.
    A techno wizard and driver extraordinaire, she is like the engine room of the team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dinielle’s skills have helped many out of tough situations. Once on a secret mission,
    she got her team out safely after having to drive through the desert with no lights on
    while being chased by gunmen. While everyone was sweating and filled with adrenaline,
    she was cooler than a cucumber.  She is calm and unstoppable. (Oh and very, very, very important: she likes to fly robots/drones!).
  </p>

  <h3>Clarina Hanekom</h3>

  <p>
    Clarina found her purpose in life working with the animals in Blikkiesdorp.
    She was a horrid teenager. Always the centre of trouble, she could care very little
    for the consequences of her actions. Truth be told, no one had much hope for any kind of bright future.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is her experiences and lessons gained through that troublesome period which makes her
    deeply empathetic to the suffering of others. Clarina has a heart bigger than the Kimberley Hole.
    She is a driving force in the community and is well respected and appreciated by both human and animal.
    One thing has not changed though: when it comes to helping others, she cares very
    little about the consequences of her actions. She is fearless and relentless.
  </p>
